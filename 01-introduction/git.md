## Integrating Git with VSCode

VSCode has built-in support for Git, and it should automatically detect it is installed on your computer. You can verify this by opening VSCode and clicking on the "Source Control" icon in the left menu. It should look something like this:

If it looks like this, you are good to go! If not, try restarting VSCode.
